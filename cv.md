### About my main aim in Rollig Scopes course:  
I want to change my current job for maximize my income.  
> Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result.  

### Skills:  
- JavaScript  
- HTML  
- Git  
  
#### Code from Codewars  
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case
```
     var countBits = function(n) {
     // Program Me
         if (n >= 0) {
         let bin = n.toString(2);
         return bin.split('1').length-1;
         }
     }; 
```
